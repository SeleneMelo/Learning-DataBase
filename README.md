Tips:
  - In SQL, keywords are not case-sensitive, but it's a good practice to make keywords uppercase to distinguish them from other parts of your query, like colummns and table names.
  - To select multiple columns from a table, separate the column names with commas.
  - SELECT DISTINCT to remove duplicate tuples.
  - Functions: COUNT()
  - If you want to count the number of non-missing values in a particular column, you can use COUNT() on just that column.
  - You can combine COUNT() with DISTINCT to count the number of distinct values in a column.
